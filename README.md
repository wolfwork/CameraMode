CameraMode
==========

A Minecraft Bukkit plugin allowing permitted players to go "CameraMode".




CameraMode, in it's released version, will allow players in cameramode to fly around
and view areas of the server normally hidden from view, without being able to exploit 
the fly ability (ussually an unavoidable risk on the server owner's part [great for youtube ranks]).
CameraMode will optionally block...



-Block Interaction
-pvp
-entity interaction
-commands
-and many more.


When the player exits cameramode, it will also return the player to the position they
were located at, upon entering cameramode.
